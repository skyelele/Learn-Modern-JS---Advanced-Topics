1. First-class functions

Functions are treated as values and can be assigned to variables and passed around.

2. The following are objects:

Functions
Arrays
User defined objects

3. True or False: A function expression is hoisted.

FALSE.

4. Object properties can be the following data types:

strings
numbers
functions
objects
arrays

5. What can you use to determine if a property exists in an object?

in
hasOwnProperty

6. The keyword this is established when a funtion is invoked.

7. The prototype of an object is another object.

8. JavaScript objects have access to properties and methods that exist in the object's prototype chain.

9. If you have a general function that acts on objects through this binding, and you would like to use this function for a specific object, how could you accomplish that?

a. Create a method on the object that references the function. Then, invoke the method.

b. Create a new function using bind and bind the object. Then, invoke the function.

c. Invoke the function using call and pass in the object.

12. When using bind, it returns what?

A function!

13. True or False: Use a constructor if you want to create multiple, similar objects.

True

14. Objects created from a constructor have the same prototype. Where does that prototype object come from?

It is the object assigned to the prototype property of the constructor function.

15. Issue with constructor functions?

If not invoked with this, it will invade the global space.

16. What are the main advantages of arrow functions?

a. They can be created with minimal syntax.
b. They define the value of this lexically instead of how JavaScript traditionally does it.
